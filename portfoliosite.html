            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This case study reviews and details my experience in building a portfolio website, showcasing the work
              I’ve completed during my CareerFoundry.com UI Immersion & Front End Development journey. This build
              represents my MVP (Minimum Viable Product),
              and will continue to grow and change over time.</p>
            <h3>Context & Challenge</h3>
            <b>Background</b>
            <p>While I have built websites in the past using coding programs like Adobe’s Dreamweaver, this site
              represents the first fully hand-coded, responsive site I’ve ever completed. I learned and applied the
              latest design techniques and build
              methodologies utilizing HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript.
            <p>
              <b>The Problem</b>
            <p>I’ve spent the bulk of my career working as a print designer, and knew that I had to update my skills to
              include the capabilities of designing and building a modern website: a responsive site built with a
              “mobile-first” mindset. To truly showcase
              my talents in both UI and Front-End Development, I needed to establish an online presence and prove to
              prospective employers that I am capable of designing, coding and managing everything from quick
              interactive prototypes to large corporate
              websites.
            <p>
              <b>Goals</b>
            <p>There were many goals that I wanted to achieve by completing this task. My main goal in completing this
              site was to build a showcase for my User Interface work. Second, I wanted to update my knowledge of modern
              web design, since my last
              interaction with web design occurred several years ago, when HTML 3 was the newest version available. I
              knew I needed to understand and show applied design with concepts such as media queries and working with
              viewports. Finally, I wanted to refresh
              my working knowledge of both CSS and Javascript, since my overall experience with both of these languages
              was minimal.</p>
            <h3>Process & Insight</h3>
            <p>Since this project was used as a method of learning front-end development, basic wire-frames of what I
              was to build were provided by CareerFoundry. Many common design patterns were already built in to the
              design, such as a collapsible navigation
              system. As the project progressed, I did make some personal choices to better fit the design to my own
              personal needs. Overall, this is a fairly simple, straightforward site, with six total pages. After coding
              the HTML framework, I began the
              process of breaking out sections of DIVs using CSS, to further position and style my content.</p>
            <p>The most challenging part of the entire build was most definitely the fabrication of the collapsible
              navigation system, which includes the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript combined. Special care was taken to
              achieve consistent placement of the menu
              options, while re-sizing the browser from a full desktop width, down to a small, mobile phone width.</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>The final design incorporates a collapsible menu system, responsive page design, and utilizes HTML 5
              features like a header & footer section. The case study pages showcase the work I completed during my UI
              Immersion. All pages were user tested on
              multiple devices and in multiple browsers, enabling me to clean up some last loose ends.</p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>As a Minimum Viable Product, I feel that I achieved a well-crafted result, that performs as I had
              intended. While I initially underestimated my level of knowledge with web design & development, the course
              proved challenging, and I’m surprised
              at how much I’ve learned in a few short months. This course and site build has definitely opened my eyes
              to the nuances of front end development and will serve as a solid base to build upon.</p>
            <h3>Future Updates</h3>
            <p>I plan on continued development of this site, and will use it as learning tool and showcase for my
              capabilities as a front end, user interface designer. That means I will revisit my code, streamlining and
              refining my initial effort. I will
              also address the rather “plain” design, adding some subtle patterns, textures and photos to liven up the
              graphic appearance. I will be adding more case studies, as I complete projects and gain valuable
              experience in my new field of choice. And
              finally, I intend to add several more pages, highlighting animated prototypes, small “mini-case studies”
              of some of the quick exercises that I found valuable in the CareerFoundry curriculum, and possibly even
              some of my creative design,
              photography and video work.</p>
