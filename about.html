          <h2 class="center">My Story</h2>

          <p>I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Yes, I'm a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, because when you
            grow up in Pittsburgh in the 70s, it's the law. I'm a graduate of both The Art Institute of Pittsburgh
            (Associate's Degree) and The Indiana University of Pennsylvania (Bachelor of Fine Arts). In my spare time
            you can find me teaching myself how to play guitar, doing concert photography or watching professional
            football on television.</p>

          <p>I've been a print-based graphic designer most of my career, but several years ago I worked my way into an
            interface designer position for a company that developed a software package that monitored and controlled
            satellite communications networks. It was there that I got my first taste of user interface design (more
            graphics related vs. coding), and I was proud that the work that I did was making a difference for customers
            as varied as The National Broadcast Company (NBC) and the United States Military. While I did my best and
            applied everything I knew about graphic design to my work, I was missing one very important piece:
            understanding the needs of a user.</p>

          <p>Fast forward to 2020, when after losing my full-time designer job because of the COVID pandemic, I thought
            that a career change was in order. It’s intriguing to me that since my time developing interfaces, both User
            Experience (UX) and User Interface Design (UI) have grown into full-blown career fields of their own. Thanks
            to CareerFoundry’s UI Immersion boot camp, I’m hoping to combine my creative experience together with the
            latest UI/UX processes and transition to a User Interface Designer. For me, this transition is the logical
            "next step" in my career, and in the next paragraph I'll tell you why.</p>

          <p>Not only do I feel like I have the right background and experience for this field, but I also feel strongly
            that I have the right personality as well. In recent months, I've taken the personality tests available at
            <a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx" target="_blank">Clifton Strengths</a>
            and <a href="https://www.16personalities.com" target="_blank">16personalities.com.</a> Here are some of the
            findings:
          </p>

          <p>Key personality traits from Clifton Strengths include:</p>
          <ol class="listfix">
            <li><b>Restorative:</b> "...adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out what is wrong and
              resolving it."</li>
            <li><b>Empathy:</b> "... can sense other people’s feelings by imagining themselves in others’ lives or
              situations."</li>
            <li><b>Arranger:</b> "They like to determine how all of the pieces and resources can be arranged for maximum
              productivity."</li>
            <li><b>Adaptability:</b> "They tend to be “now” people who take things as they come and discover the future
              one day at a time."</li>
          </ol>

          <p>...and from 16 personalities.com, the "Advocate" personality type:</p>
          <ol class="listfix">
            <li><b>Creative:</b> "Advocate personalities enjoy finding the perfect solution for the people they care
              about. To do this, they draw on their vivid imagination and their strong sense of compassion."</li>
            <li><b>Insightful:</b> "Advocates typically strive to move past appearances and get to the heart of things.
              This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and
              needs."</li>
            <li><b>Principled:</b> "People with the Advocate personality type tend to have deeply held beliefs, and
              their conviction often shines through when they speak or write about subjects that matter to them."</li>
            <li><b>Passionate:</b> "Advocates can pursue their ideals with a single-mindedness that may catch others off
              guard. These personalities rarely settle for “good enough,” and their willingness to disrupt the status
              quo may not please
              everyone. That said, Advocates’ passion for their chosen cause is a key aspect of their personality."</li>
            <li><b>Altruistic:</b> "Advocates generally aim to use their strengths for the greater good – they rarely
              enjoy succeeding at other people’s expense. They tend to think about how their actions affect others, and
              their goal is to behave
              in a way that will help the people around them and make the world a better place."</li>
          </ol>
