            <h2 class="center">My Story</h2>

            <p>I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Yes, I'm a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, because when you grow up in Pittsburgh in the 70s, it's the law. I'm a graduate of The Art Institute of Pittsburgh (Associate's Degree) and Indiana
              University of Pennsylvania (Bachelor of Fine Arts). In my spare time you can find me teaching myself how to play guitar, enjoying photography or watching professional football on television.</p>

            <p>I've been a print-based graphic designer most of my career, but several years ago I worked my way into an interface designer position for a company that developed a software package that monitored and controlled satellite
              communications networks. It was there that I got my first taste at designing an entire system - a tool that a user would be using every day - in a high-tech software package that was critical to everyone from The National Broadcast
              Company (NBC) to the United States Military. While I did my best and applied everything I knew about graphic design to my work, I was missing one very important piece: understanding the needs of a user.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to 2020. I lost my full-time graphic designer job because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I realized that a career change was in order. It didn't take long for me to realize that both User Experience (UX) and User Interface
              Design (UI) have grown into full-blown career fields of their own. With my previous interface experience still in the back of my mind, I'm now hoping to combine my creative experience together with the latest UI/UX processes and
              transition to a User Interface Designer. For me, this transition is the logical "next step" in my career, and in the next paragraph I'll tell you why.</p>

            <p>Not only do I feel like I have the right background and experience for this field, but I also feel strongly that I have the right personality as well. In recent months, I've taken the personality tests available at <a
                href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx" target="_blank">Clifton Strengths</a> and <a href="https://www.16personalities.com" target="_blank">16personalities.com.</a> Here are some of the findings:</p>

            <p>Key personality traits from Clifton Strengths include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Restorative:</b> "...adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it."</li>
              <li><b>Empathy:</b> "... can sense other people’s feelings by imagining themselves in others’ lives or situations."</li>
              <li><b>Arranger:</b> "They like to determine how all of the pieces and resources can be arranged for maximum productivity."</li>
              <li><b>Adaptability:</b> "They tend to be “now” people who take things as they come and discover the future one day at a time."</li>
            </ol>

            <p>...and from 16 personalities.com, the "Advocate" personality type:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Creative:</b> "Advocate personalities enjoy finding the perfect solution for the people they care about. To do this, they draw on their vivid imagination and their strong sense of compassion."</li>
              <li><b>Insightful:</b> "Advocates typically strive to move past appearances and get to the heart of things. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs."</li>
              <li><b>Principled:</b> "People with the Advocate personality type tend to have deeply held beliefs, and their conviction often shines through when they speak or write about subjects that matter to them."</li>
              <li><b>Passionate:</b> "Advocates can pursue their ideals with a single-mindedness that may catch others off guard. These personalities rarely settle for “good enough,” and their willingness to disrupt the status quo may not please
                everyone. That said, Advocates’ passion for their chosen cause is a key aspect of their personality."</li>
              <li><b>Altruistic:</b> "Advocates generally aim to use their strengths for the greater good – they rarely enjoy succeeding at other people’s expense. They tend to think about how their actions affect others, and their goal is to behave
                in a way that will help the people around them and make the world a better place."</li>
            </ol>
